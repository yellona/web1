<h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
<h3>JAVASCRIPT란 무엇인가?</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">JAVASCRIPT</a>
is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class
functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser
environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a
prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative,
and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.</p>

<p>This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are
specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about APIs specific to Web pages,
please see Web APIs and DOM.</p>
